# "Under Construction"
## Insert classic Geocities construction_worker.gif
### I'm building the actual image library now. The layout and gallery plugin is done.

<p>These are what I think give some feel for what kind of projects I like to get into.<br />
This isn't a complete representation, and unfortunately doesn't/can't include work<br />
involving aircraft wiring build/repair because I'm not allowed to have a camera there.<br />
Honestly, I'm new to documenting my work and I've never quite been one to show it off<br />
so there's also many cases in which I'd neglected to bother snapping photos.</p>

<p>Anyhow, this gallery contains examples spanning about ten years. Alas, my workmanship<br />
has drastically improved over this span so an old project would probably look a lot<br />
different if I'd built it today. For that reason I cut a lot out because I just don't<br />
think it represents great craftsmanship.</p>

### Sort Images Based on Filter. Click images to expand and read descriptions.
