<!-- ### "Under Construction" 9/25/17: Metadata to be added to fix sorting functionality. -->

<p>These are a few examples of what kind of projects I like to get into.<br />
This isn't a complete representation, and some work can't be shown (USAF).<br />
Anyhow, this gallery contains examples spanning about ten years. Alas, my workmanship<br />
has drastically improved over this span so craftsmanship may be up to current par on old work.<br />
