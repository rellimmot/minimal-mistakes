excerpt: "This is my Project Log. This is my honest attempt at documenting my work, and my sharing creative methods. This site is in at early stage. I am a lifelong hobbyist, veteran, and early career Electrical Engineer currently living in New Orleans. I like to make and fix everything, especially airplanes, cars, robots, 3D printing, and electronics. Sometimes I also make art."
intro:
  - excerpt: 'View my Portfolio to find articles documenting my work. As the articles grow in population, Iâ€™ll sort them into collections. As of now I am still populating the site, so I have got some writing to do.'
